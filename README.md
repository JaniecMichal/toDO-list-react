# Welcome to my ToDO List
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

![ToDO List by {Imperator}](https://github.com/JaniecMichal/toDO-list-react/blob/master/src/App/images/OpenGraphImage.png?raw=true)

This is my first web app made during YouCode frontend course.  This app it is ToDO list in React.js. App state is storing in store provided by Redux. Tasks storing in localStorage for now is unavaiable.

Demo --> [ToDO List by {Imperator}](https://janiecmichal.github.io/toDO-list-react/)

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- React.js
- styled-components
- customs-hooks
- Imutabillity added to JS
- React-Redux
- Redux-Toolkit

## How to use?
1. Write task into text input and submit by button.
2. In ToDo List panel you see all tasks which you wrote.
3. If any task had done then you can click green button and toggle state of task into "done".
4. When you don't need to see done task on list you can remove them by red button.

### Live manual to app:
Please see below animated gif which show how app looks and how to use my ToDO list in practise.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
